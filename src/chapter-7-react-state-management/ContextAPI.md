### 1\. **Introduction to React Context API**

The **Context API** in React is a tool for state management that avoids the problem of **prop drilling** (passing data down through multiple layers of components). Instead of passing data through intermediate components, the Context API allows you to make data globally available to all components that need it. It avoids performance issues and large bundle sizes that state management libraries might cause.

### 2\. **Using the React Context API**

To use Context, there are three main steps:

*   **Context Creator**: You create a context using createContext() (similar to a Redux store).
    
*   **Context Provider**: The Provider component allows components to access the context's data.
    
*   **Context Consumer**: The Consumer component allows components to use the context's data.
